# Assignment 2 of Experimental Robotics Laboratory course

This is the second assignment of the course, in this assignment I have had to implement some features of the robot in a cluedo game environment. In particular: planning part and robot description and his movements in an simulation environment.
Also some little changes have been made, but the main concept has been maintained. 
In particular: you have a robot, which must find hints, like it is playing cluedo game, it must reason about possible complete hypotheses and then, it must ask to the oracle if the hypothesis is correct. If it is not, the robot must go on and keep playing until it finds the solution.
