<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
Introduction</h1>
<p>The assignment concerns a robot that has to move randomly in a Cluedo Environment, it enters in the rooms, where it receives some hints. Through the hints the robot must reason and generate hypotheses which have to be consistent, must go to the oracle that knows which hypothesis is the truth and ask him. If the robot has guessed the hypothesis the robot won, else the robot continues to play. The rooms are:</p><ul>
<li>x:-4 , y:-3;</li>
<li>x:-4 , y:2;</li>
<li>x:-4 , y:7;</li>
<li>x:5 , y:-7;</li>
<li>x:5 , y:-3,;</li>
<li>x:5 , y:1;</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I added some other reference points, call corridors:</p><ul>
<li>x:-1 , y:6;</li>
<li>x:0 , y:-4;</li>
<li>x:-3 , y:-2;</li>
<li>x:1 , y:-7;</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that:</p><ul>
<li>A <b>consistent</b> hypothesis is a hypothesis which is not inconsistent and is complete.</li>
<li>A <b>complete</b> hypothesis is a hypothesis which has at least one value for each field.</li>
<li>A <b>inconsistent</b> hypothesis is a hypothesis which has more than one value in at least one field.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
System Architecture</h1>
<p>System architecture is presented in two ways: component diagram and temporal diagram.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Component diagram</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48513075/174858144-dfdfbf52-9c6d-47c9-8612-23cdec851025.png" alt="Component Diagram" class="inline"/></p>
<p>List of components:</p><ul>
<li>SMACH component: this component is used as State Machine manager. It implements the infrastructure of a State Machine and, in theory, also the visualization part of it;</li>
<li>FSM component: this component actually implements the State Machine. So every node is a version of the finite state machine applied into the problem. This component is a sort of brain of the robot, it controls his behavior. FSM is composed by 5 states, each of them is 'Navigation', 'Investigation', 'GoToOracle', 'Assert' and 'Finished'.<ul>
<li>Navigation: this state will call RandomPlace Service in order to get a random position. After that, it uses the Navigation component, which will call MoveBase algorithm.</li>
<li>Investigation: this state will first call <a class="el" href="class_my_move_it.html">MyMoveIt</a> component in order the robot to reach a precise pose called 'check low first', then it turns until it make an angle of 360°, then it does the same with the pose 'check high first'. In theory with this method, thanks to the width and height of the image camera, every hints can be found. Note that some rooms, called corridors, are added to the list in order to be sure the robot will discover all the hints.</li>
<li>GoToOracle: this state simply calls MoveBase in order to reache GoToOracle position: (0,-1).</li>
<li>Assert: this node calls Investigate component in order to get the consistent hypotheses. These hypotheses are compared with the true one given by the Oracle.</li>
<li>Finished: this state formulates the famous Cluedo Game final sentence and tells you that you have won.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Navigation component: this component will use RandomPlace service, given by FSM component, in order to get the 2D pose of the robot and then calls MoveBase component in order to manage Navigation part. When the robot arrives to the point it stops the robot motion.</li>
<li>RandomPlace component: this component uses the list of the possible target rooms and generates a sequence of them. Note that, thanks to an index, this sequence is in fact a circular buffer, so that the robot could continue to navigate to the rooms as much as one want.</li>
<li>MoveBase component: this component is represented by the algorithm MoveBase. You can look to a better explaining of how it works <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/move_base">here</a>.</li>
<li>Investigation component: this component is the interface between the Reasoner and the rest of the world. This component manages the operations between hints received and the reasoning about them. Also it is useful in the conversion from the marker id to the hint id.</li>
<li>Reasoner component: this component is an <em>ad</em> <em>hoc</em> reasoner. This means you cannot upload an ontology, but it is useful only in this case.</li>
<li>Simulation component: this component is the component given by professors in order to setup the environment. This component gives the solution of the game, gives an hint given a marker id and places markers and walls around, in the simulation environment.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_my_move_it.html">MyMoveIt</a> component: this component uses MoveIt package in order to perform <em>arm</em> movements. Custom pose and General pose are implemented.</li>
<li>MoveIt component: this component uses motion-planning in order to effectively perform <em>arm</em> movements. You can visit their website <a href="https://moveit.ros.org/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Rviz/Gazebo component: even I've put this components together their are in fact two different component. They are used also in the previous assignments, here they are mentioned for precision sake. In Gazebo there are the walls that build the environment given by professor. RViz is used for visualizing the path planning, moveit planning and camera.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
Temporal diagram</h2>
<p>Let's consider a lucky case: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48513075/175829077-e84ad055-0e60-46b2-8370-8470fb6d9c95.png" alt="Temporal Diagram" class="inline"/></p>
<p>This temporal diagram shows a lucky case where the investigation is short. In this example the robot goes to a location where it finds some hints, during the travel and during the investigation phase. After completed this phase, the robot has not found a consistent hypothesis. So it must go to another destination, where it starts investing. After this investigation phase, the robot has found a consistent hypothesis. So it goes to the oracle for asking if it is the correct hypothesis. Luckily it is the correct hypothesis so the game finished.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Installation and Running Procedure</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Installation</h2>
<p>In order to install this package we have to be sure to have all the components. ROS environment is of course trivial, but it is needed also a particular package which is 'move_base', so make sure you have installed it. From this branch, copy <a class="el" href="namespace_experimental_robotics_lab.html">ExperimentalRoboticsLab</a> folder, and paste it into the workspace. Armor reasoner has been substitued by a custom reasoner, so that package is no more required. PDDL has been used nomore, so is valid same for it. MoveIt package has been changed together with robot description, so another branch has been added: <a href="https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/ExperimentalRoboticsLab/tree/m2wr_moveit2">m2wr_moveit2</a>. From this branch, copy the folder 'm2wr_moveit' and paste it into the workspace. ArUco Ros package is used for marker detection. You can find a modified version in the branch: <a href="https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/ExperimentalRoboticsLab/tree/aruco_ros_package">aruco_ros_package</a>. From this branch, copy the folder 'aruco_ros' (note that there are two aruco_ros folder, the above-mentioned folder is the parent one), and paste it into the workspace. Compile the workspace with the command: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES=&quot;&quot;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The package is now ready.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
Running Procedure</h2>
<p>After sourcing the terminal:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">source bash.sh</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>In order to launch the program, go into the <a class="el" href="namespace_experimental_robotics_lab.html">ExperimentalRoboticsLab</a> folder and write write in the terminal:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">./short.sh</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The previous one was the recommended running procedure. But this is not the only one way, of course, single launch file can be launched in different terminals, in each of them you have to go into the folder: <a class="el" href="namespace_experimental_robotics_lab.html">ExperimentalRoboticsLab</a> and run:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">source ros.sh </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Then the sequence, in each terminal: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab simulation.launch 2&gt;/dev/null</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"><div class="line">roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab assignment3_short.launch</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"><div class="line">roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab investigation.launch</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"><div class="line">roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab final.launch 2&gt;/dev/null</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"><div class="line">roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab navigation.launch 2&gt;/dev/null</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>You can get rid of the '2&gt;/dev/null' if you want to see warnings. </p>

Assumptions, working hypotheses and environment</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Motors can be strong as will;</li>
<li>Camera can assume the desired properties;</li>
<li>Odometry is perfectly known;</li>
<li>Rooms are large enough to maneouver the robot in its space;</li>
<li>Robot is not self-collidable;</li>
<li>Walls are static objects;</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
System's features</h2>
<p>The system is capable of simulating an environment, with some limitations, where the robot has to reach a position and receives hints which will let him to reason on them and arriving to some solutions (aka consistent hypotheses). Hints can be found anywhere in the environment, on floor or on top walls. One solution is the right one and can be revealed when the robots arrives to the oracle and ask for the right solution. The environment is represented by a static map, where we have many rooms; this conformation introduces static obstacles, so that a path planning algorithm should take into account also static obstacles. MoveBase algorithm has been chosen in order to overcome this problem, in addition MoveBase is also used for dynamic obstacles, but in this context it is not necessary. MoveIt package has not been changed so much. Only Ros Controllers have been changed a bit in order to adapt to the new robot description. In fact the robot has been changed because of chassis dimensions, which were a bit bigger than what needed for stabilization of the robot. This is also due to the fact that robot arm has been shortened, which has been possible because of the fact that a pose was no more needed, but only a camera view was necessary. Due to this fact and thanks to the camera height and width, investigation is possible only assuming two poses and turning around. Even if environment morphology is not known by the robot, some points are given as rooms. But to be sure that with my method, all hints are found, it is necessary that all the area is covered, so more points are added to the list of possible destination. In the investigation phase, the only reason when it reaches the end of the investigation, this is, in my opinion, a correct trade off. Let's suppose we have reasoned every hints added, if a consistent hypothesis is found, then it could be the right one or not. If it is the right one and we reason, we speed up the process, but it is a very lucky case. In every other situation, we should change the paradigm and store the information about the last position and we should go back to that position, wasting time. In fact investigation phase is less time demanding than navigation one. Let's note that, differently from the previous assignment Armor has been substituded with a custom reasoner. This has been done because of the setup of ArmorClient: even if in the previous assignments a timeout has been set up in order to not fail the connection between ArmorClient and ArmorServer, this technique does not guarantee that the connection will always succeed. In particular when we have other computing demanding programs, the connection could not be as fast as necessary, causing a system failure (which is not suitable in a system which must be safe).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
System's limitations</h2>
<p>Here below are presented some system's limitations:</p><ul>
<li>Reasoner is not flexible, Armor solution had this property, but my custom reasoner not;</li>
<li>Ros Controllers have not been set up using a Ziegler–Nichols or algorithms of that sort, but using trial and error. Even if they are better than previous assignment in performance;</li>
<li>In order to complete an investigation phase, a full turn is performed twice, base on time, not on the angle formed. This lead to two different limitations:<ul>
<li>Camera width must be enough to compensate some error in the investigation;</li>
<li>It is a slow mechanical process;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are no dynamic obstacles in this environment. It could be a right way of testing the environment, since it is a more precise approximation of reality;</li>
<li>Navigation is not very fast, arm introduces an imbalance part of the robot;</li>
<li>Random waypoint navigation does not perform very well, an approach which takes into account the waypoint relative position and navigation time would be better;</li>
<li>User Interface may help in start and restart the game.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
Possible improvements</h2>
<p>Improvements are divided in the following way: optimizations and realism. </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md15"></a>
Optimization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ros Controllers could be trajectory ones. They would simplify investigation phase;</li>
<li>Reasoner could be a trade off of the Armor general one and my custom solution, in order to be more flexible, but faster and safe;</li>
<li>Motors can be optimized in order to be as fast and stable as possible; </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
Realism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Environment lacks of obstacles for arm movements;</li>
<li>Dynamic objects must be introduced;</li>
</ul>
