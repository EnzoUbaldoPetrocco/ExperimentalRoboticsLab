This repository represents the third assignment of Experimental Robotics Lab course.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
The assignment concerns a robot that has to move randomly in a Cluedo Environment, it enters in the rooms, where it receives some hints. Through the hints the robot must reason and generate hypotheses which have to be consistent, must go to the oracle that knows which hypothesis is the truth and ask him. If the robot has guessed the hypothesis the robot won, else the robot continues to play. The rooms are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item x\+:-\/4 , y\+:-\/3;
\item x\+:-\/4 , y\+:2;
\item x\+:-\/4 , y\+:7;
\item x\+:5 , y\+:-\/7;
\item x\+:5 , y\+:-\/3,;
\item x\+:5 , y\+:1;
\end{DoxyItemize}

Then I added some other reference points, call corridors\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item x\+:-\/1 , y\+:6;
\item x\+:0 , y\+:-\/4;
\item x\+:-\/3 , y\+:-\/2;
\item x\+:1 , y\+:-\/7;
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A {\bfseries{consistent}} hypothesis is a hypothesis which is not inconsistent and is complete.
\item A {\bfseries{complete}} hypothesis is a hypothesis which has at least one value for each field.
\item A {\bfseries{inconsistent}} hypothesis is a hypothesis which has more than one value in at least one field.
\end{DoxyItemize}

System architecture is presented in two ways\+: component diagram and temporal diagram.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Component diagram}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}


List of components\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+M\+A\+CH component\+: this component is used as State Machine manager. It implements the infrastructure of a State Machine and, in theory, also the visualization part of it;
\item F\+SM component\+: this component actually implements the State Machine. So every node is a version of the finite state machine applied into the problem. This component is a sort of brain of the robot, it controls his behavior. F\+SM is composed by 5 states, each of them is \textquotesingle{}Navigation\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}Investigation\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}Go\+To\+Oracle\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}Assert\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}Finished\textquotesingle{}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Navigation\+: this state will call Random\+Place Service in order to get a random position. After that, it uses the Navigation component, which will call Move\+Base algorithm.
\item Investigation\+: this state will first call \mbox{\hyperlink{class_my_move_it}{My\+Move\+It}} component in order the robot to reach a precise pose called \textquotesingle{}check low first\textquotesingle{}, then it turns until it make an angle of 360°, then it does the same with the pose \textquotesingle{}check high first\textquotesingle{}. In theory with this method, thanks to the width and height of the image camera, every hints can be found. Note that some rooms, called corridors, are added to the list in order to be sure the robot will discover all the hints.
\item Go\+To\+Oracle\+: this state simply calls Move\+Base in order to reache Go\+To\+Oracle position\+: (0,-\/1).
\item Assert\+: this node calls Investigate component in order to get the consistent hypotheses. These hypotheses are compared with the true one given by the Oracle.
\item Finished\+: this state formulates the famous Cluedo Game final sentence and tells you that you have won.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Navigation component\+: this component will use Random\+Place service, given by F\+SM component, in order to get the 2D pose of the robot and then calls Move\+Base component in order to manage Navigation part. When the robot arrives to the point it stops the robot motion.
\item Random\+Place component\+: this component uses the list of the possible target rooms and generates a sequence of them. Note that, thanks to an index, this sequence is in fact a circular buffer, so that the robot could continue to navigate to the rooms as much as one want.
\item Move\+Base component\+: this component is represented by the algorithm Move\+Base. You can look to a better explaining of how it works \href{http://wiki.ros.org/move_base}{\texttt{ here}}.
\item Investigation component\+: this component is the interface between the Reasoner and the rest of the world. This component manages the operations between hints received and the reasoning about them. Also it is useful in the conversion from the marker id to the hint id.
\item Reasoner component\+: this component is an {\itshape ad} {\itshape hoc} reasoner. This means you cannot upload an ontology, but it is useful only in this case.
\item Simulation component\+: this component is the component given by professors in order to setup the environment. This component gives the solution of the game, gives an hint given a marker id and places markers and walls around, in the simulation environment.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_my_move_it}{My\+Move\+It}} component\+: this component uses Move\+It package in order to perform {\itshape arm} movements. Custom pose and General pose are implemented.
\item Move\+It component\+: this component uses motion-\/planning in order to effectively perform {\itshape arm} movements. You can visit their website \href{https://moveit.ros.org/}{\texttt{ here}}.
\item Rviz/\+Gazebo component\+: even I\textquotesingle{}ve put this components together their are in fact two different component. They are used also in the previous assignments, here they are mentioned for precision sake. In Gazebo there are the walls that build the environment given by professor. R\+Viz is used for visualizing the path planning, moveit planning and camera.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Temporal diagram}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
Let\textquotesingle{}s consider a lucky case\+: 

This temporal diagram shows a lucky case where the investigation is short. In this example the robot goes to a location where it finds some hints, during the travel and during the investigation phase. After completed this phase, the robot has not found a consistent hypothesis. So it must go to another destination, where it starts investing. After this investigation phase, the robot has found a consistent hypothesis. So it goes to the oracle for asking if it is the correct hypothesis. Luckily it is the correct hypothesis so the game finished.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{A Sample of the Scenario}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}
In order to install this package we have to be sure to have all the components. R\+OS environment is of course trivial, but it is needed also a particular package which is \textquotesingle{}move\+\_\+base\textquotesingle{}, so make sure you have installed it. From this branch, copy \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_experimental_robotics_lab}{Experimental\+Robotics\+Lab}} folder, and paste it into the workspace. Armor reasoner has been substitued by a custom reasoner, so that package is no more required. P\+D\+DL has been used nomore, so is valid same for it. Move\+It package has been changed together with robot description, so another branch has been added\+: \href{https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/ExperimentalRoboticsLab/tree/m2wr_moveit2}{\texttt{ m2wr\+\_\+moveit2}}. From this branch, copy the folder \textquotesingle{}m2wr\+\_\+moveit\textquotesingle{} and paste it into the workspace. Ar\+Uco Ros package is used for marker detection. You can find a modified version in the branch\+: \href{https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/ExperimentalRoboticsLab/tree/aruco_ros_package}{\texttt{ aruco\+\_\+ros\+\_\+package}}. From this branch, copy the folder \textquotesingle{}aruco\+\_\+ros\textquotesingle{} (note that there are two aruco\+\_\+ros folder, the above-\/mentioned folder is the parent one), and paste it into the workspace. Compile the workspace with the command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{catkin\_make -\/DCATKIN\_WHITELIST\_PACKAGES=""}
\end{DoxyCode}


The package is now ready.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Running Procedure}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
After sourcing the terminal\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source bash.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


In order to launch the program, go into the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_experimental_robotics_lab}{Experimental\+Robotics\+Lab}} folder and write write in the terminal\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./short.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


The previous one was the recommended running procedure. But this is not the only one way, of course, single launch file can be launched in different terminals, in each of them you have to go into the folder\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_experimental_robotics_lab}{Experimental\+Robotics\+Lab}} and run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source ros.sh }
\end{DoxyCode}


Then the sequence, in each terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab simulation.launch 2>/dev/null}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab assignment3\_short.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab investigation.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab final.launch 2>/dev/null}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch ExperimentalRoboticsLab navigation.launch 2>/dev/null}
\end{DoxyCode}


You can get rid of the \textquotesingle{}2$>$/dev/null\textquotesingle{} if you want to see warnings. \hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Assumptions, working hypotheses and environment}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{Assumptions}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Motors can be strong as will;
\item Camera can assume the desired properties;
\item Odometry is perfectly known;
\item Rooms are large enough to maneouver the robot in its space;
\item Robot is not self-\/collidable;
\item Walls are static objects;
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{System\textquotesingle{}s features}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}
The system is capable of simulating an environment, with some limitations, where the robot has to reach a position and receives hints which will let him to reason on them and arriving to some solutions (aka consistent hypotheses). Hints can be found anywhere in the environment, on floor or on top walls. One solution is the right one and can be revealed when the robots arrives to the oracle and ask for the right solution. The environment is represented by a static map, where we have many rooms; this conformation introduces static obstacles, so that a path planning algorithm should take into account also static obstacles. Move\+Base algorithm has been chosen in order to overcome this problem, in addition Move\+Base is also used for dynamic obstacles, but in this context it is not necessary. Move\+It package has not been changed so much. Only Ros Controllers have been changed a bit in order to adapt to the new robot description. In fact the robot has been changed because of chassis dimensions, which were a bit bigger than what needed for stabilization of the robot. This is also due to the fact that robot arm has been shortened, which has been possible because of the fact that a pose was no more needed, but only a camera view was necessary. Due to this fact and thanks to the camera height and width, investigation is possible only assuming two poses and turning around. Even if environment morphology is not known by the robot, some points are given as rooms. But to be sure that with my method, all hints are found, it is necessary that all the area is covered, so more points are added to the list of possible destination. In the investigation phase, the only reason when it reaches the end of the investigation, this is, in my opinion, a correct trade off. Let\textquotesingle{}s suppose we have reasoned every hints added, if a consistent hypothesis is found, then it could be the right one or not. If it is the right one and we reason, we speed up the process, but it is a very lucky case. In every other situation, we should change the paradigm and store the information about the last position and we should go back to that position, wasting time. In fact investigation phase is less time demanding than navigation one. Let\textquotesingle{}s note that, differently from the previous assignment Armor has been substituded with a custom reasoner. This has been done because of the setup of Armor\+Client\+: even if in the previous assignments a timeout has been set up in order to not fail the connection between Armor\+Client and Armor\+Server, this technique does not guarantee that the connection will always succeed. In particular when we have other computing demanding programs, the connection could not be as fast as necessary, causing a system failure (which is not suitable in a system which must be safe).\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsection{System\textquotesingle{}s limitations}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}
Here below are presented some system\textquotesingle{}s limitations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Reasoner is not flexible, Armor solution had this property, but my custom reasoner not;
\item Ros Controllers have not been set up using a Ziegler–\+Nichols or algorithms of that sort, but using trial and error. Even if they are better than previous assignment in performance;
\item In order to complete an investigation phase, a full turn is performed twice, base on time, not on the angle formed. This lead to two different limitations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Camera width must be enough to compensate some error in the investigation;
\item It is a slow mechanical process;
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item There are no dynamic obstacles in this environment. It could be a right way of testing the environment, since it is a more precise approximation of reality;
\item Navigation is not very fast, arm introduces an imbalance part of the robot;
\item Random waypoint navigation does not perform very well, an approach which takes into account the waypoint relative position and navigation time would be better;
\item User Interface may help in start and restart the game.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsection{Possible improvements}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14}
Improvements are divided in the following way\+: optimizations and realism. \hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsubsection{Optimization}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md15}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ros Controllers could be trajectory ones. They would simplify investigation phase;
\item Reasoner could be a trade off of the Armor general one and my custom solution, in order to be more flexible, but faster and safe;
\item Motors can be optimized in order to be as fast and stable as possible;

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Environment lacks of obstacles for arm movements;
\item Dynamic objects must be introduced;
